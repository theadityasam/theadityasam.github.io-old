			"process": "A process scheduling simulator that simulates different scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority Pre-emptive(PP) and Priority Non Pre-emptive(PNP).",
			"processSub": "I created a feature rich simulator that was clean, intuitive and supported changing speeds, pause, resume and stop functions. Users can input their own job table as well as generate a random job table. The ready queue as well as Gantt chart is displayed after every second for greater understanding of the working of the algorithms.",
			"conclusion": [
				"Developed applications with Java language",
				"Gained expertise in using GUI builders",
				"Improved skills writing dynamic functions that do more with less code",
				"Improved fundamentals of OOPS and Operating Systems"
